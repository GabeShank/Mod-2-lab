print('A man has woken up in a leveled city with no one around and no explanation for what has happened. ')
print('He comes to find one building in perfect condition, a vast library, and yet still no one is around. ')
print('He realizes that his only form of entertainment are these books and plans on using the rest of his days in the pursuit of knowledeg.')
print('He trips and falls and drops his glasses, while looking for them he hears a crunch and knows his fate has been sealed')
print('A man now with no glasses, no one to talk too, and no way of reading is now found with many years ahead of him and nothing to do with them')
